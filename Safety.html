<p>Using a knife is one of the most riskiest parts of cooking. It requires utmost concentration
and quite a bit of experience to reduce risk to the minimum. If the person cooking is using a knife for the first time or is
inexperienced there are a few safety tips to avoid getting hurt. For starters we can firt clear our chopping board and make sure the surface on which we are cutting on is flat
Another preacution while handling a knife is to never wave it in the air. Even though this might sound stupid people still do it without realizing and often cut themselves.
Another very important precaution is to keep the sharp part of the kinf facing downwards always. Following these safety precautions will reduce the risk of getting cut by a knife.

     <p> Using a stove is another dangerous risk while cooking. At times people burn their houses down and  get severely burnt because of this.
       However those are very rare cases when people are very careless and clumsy. To avoid getting burnt we must follow a few safety precautions.
       The first Safety Precaution we can follow is to avoid touching the pan while it is hot. We must also be careful to not directly touch the fire
       or spill whatever is cooking in the pan because if it is hot boiling oil and it falls on the person cooking the person would be gravely wounded.
       another important Safety precaution would be to make sure that there are no flamable things next to the stove. The last precaution to take is to turn off the stove completely after using it.

<p> Using an Oven is an essential part of baking and cooking. With the positives that come with an oven
      there are many risks that are associated with it as well. There are a few safety precautions that can reduce risk and
      if followed appropriately will keep the person using the oven safe. The most important precaution to follow is to never reach across hot burners
      Always pull out the racks when moving food in or out of the oven. Another Safety precaution to follow is to always use dry oven mittens when taking
      food out of the oven. The last precaution to follow is to always make sure to stand out the way when opening an oven. If this is not followed the big amount of heat from the Oven
      will get released immediately on the person using the oven while opening it.
