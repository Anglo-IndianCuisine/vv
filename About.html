          <p class="intro-desc">The term “Anglo-Indian” refers to British colonials residing in India. Their long stay in the country resulted in the emergence of a race of people born to British fathers and Indian mothers, who also called themselves Anglo-Indians.
            the specialty of the Anglo-Indian community is its cuisine that has been going on even after the end if the British empire. The Anglo-Indians who were influenced by the Portuguese, British, Dutch and French incorporated numerous
            herbs and spices that grew around them and developed their own cuisine. Most spices used in this cuisine
            can be found in any Indian kitchen. The most well known Anglo-Indian chef is Bridget Kumar – the Queen of Anglo-Indian Cooking, whose cookbook – Anglo-Indian Cuisine,
            A legacy of The Past – is a bible for Anglo Indian food lovers. </p>

          <p class="intro-desc">Anglo Indian cuisine was influenced by the different European invasions in India and has evolved over time. Anglo-Indian cuisine is one of the very first fusion cuisines witnessed by India. It is a perfect balance of the English and the
            Indian tastes. It is neither too bland nor too spicy. There is certain appeal to the Anglo-Indian cuisine with its old-fashioned names like ‘Railway Mutton curry’, ‘Devil’s pork curry’, ‘Anglo-Indian mince ball curry’, ‘Daak bungalow
            curry’, ‘Bengal Lancer’s Shrimp curry’ and many more. Anglo-Indian food carries diverse influence from various parts of India.
            For example, Anglo-Indian recipes originating from Bengal used mustard oil as the cooking medium,
            while recipes from down south use coconut oil. The tradition and the word of mouth, to date,
            have preserved these invaluable recipes. Well known dishes include chutney, shepherd’s pie,
            jam fry, pepper fry, devilled eggs, Anglo-Indian cutlets, bread and butter pudding etc. </p>
            <br>
            <br>
          <p class="intro-desc">What makes Anglo-Indian cuisine more unique are the various spices used to give the cuisine its unique flavour and authenticity. Adding spices and other ingredients to Western dishes gave them a mild Indian flavour.
            Thus cumin and red chillies were seasoned with soups, roasts were cooked in whole spices such as cloves, pepper and cinnamon, rissoles and croquettes came to flavour with turmeric and garam masala. The "curry" concept that started out as
            a watery concoction with the addition of a few spices to meat and vegetables became the 'food trend' of the time. Worcestershire sauce, mulligatawny soup, ketchup, etc. were some of the early cooks or khansamas' first
            creations or culinary developments to cater for the new craze for 'Indian spice-flavored food.'</p>

          <p class="intro-desc">Anglo-Indian cuisine evolved over several hundred years as a result of reinventing and reinterpreting recognisably western cuisine through the unification and merging of ingredients and cooking techniques from across the Indian
            subcontinent.
            Thus came into being a completely new multicultural cuisine, making it truly "Anglo-Indian" in nature, which was neither too smooth nor too spicy, but with a distinctive flavour. The Anglo-Indian food 's distinctive taste can not be
            described in words. The cultural influence was so appealing that chutneys, rice, curries and Indian breads became a part of British cuisine. Indians were introduced to the delicious soup, to name only a few, beef roasts. The Anglo-Indian
            cuisine gradually adapted to local and regional cuisine, turning out to be a delicious flavour blend.</p>
